G’day! I’m Lachlan, a Development Team Lead from Melbourne, and this is where I post some of my thoughts around software development, management, leadership, and anything else which piques my interest. I’ve picked up experience with a few different platforms (macOS, Windows, Azure) and languages (C#, C++, JavaScript, Objective-C) over the years; currently, I’m working on .NET Core applications designed to run in the cloud.
