G'day! I'm Lachlan and this is where I post some of my thoughts around software development. I've picked up experience with a few different platforms (MacOS, Windows, Azure) and languages (C#, C++, JavaScript, Objective-C) over the years, but currently I'm primarily working on .NET Framework and .NET Core applications designed to run on-premises and in the cloud.
