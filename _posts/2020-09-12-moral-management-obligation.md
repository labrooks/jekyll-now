title: The Moral Obligation of Management

While reading "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi, I was particularly struck by a passage where the author realizes that being excellent at your job in the high-stakes world of neurosurgery is a moral responsibility.

> The pain of failure had led me to understand that technical excellence was a moral requirement. Good intentions were not enough, not when so much depended on my skills, when the difference between tragedy and triumph was defined by one or two millimeters.

I'm not in neurosurgery - the results of my professional work are almost certainly not going to be life and death. However, as I have gained more responsibility throughout my career, the moral obligation I feel to be technically excellent has undoubtedly increased. I believe this is directly related to the relative importance of me performing my role, especially regarding how I manage, mentor, and support the people who report to me.

One essential thing for new managers to recognize and respect is that they significantly impact their team's well-being. In the capacity of an individual contributor (in most business contexts), the cost of technical mediocrity may be unhappy customers, an increased workload for teammates, or any other number of adverse outcomes, but rarely is someone's well-being directly on the line. Managers have a very different burden; your people's engagement, happiness, and more may depend on the decisions you make. I found this transition from an individual contributor to a people leader sobering - as someone with responsibility for people; mistakes could now have a significantly negative impact on my team's well-being. 

Improving your employees' well-being is a noble cause in and of itself, but it's also worth drawing attention to the fact that it also drives improved outcomes for your organization.

With the impact of management skills firmly in mind, there are three broad ways any manager can improve the way they support their team
- Improving emotional intelligence
- Gaining additional knowledge of line management skills and techniques including but not limited to performance reviews, 1-1s, coaching, and mentoring
- Effectively advocating for initiatives or strategies which would support your team's well-being in broader discussions (department-wide, organization-wide)
- 
This article isn't about how to do any of those things, but I'd suggest if you take your team's well-being seriously, you should invest in self-improvement in each of those categories regularly. 

Do you think managers have a *moral* obligation be excellent at what they do? I think so, although I'm willing to admit I can take my job too seriously - on the other hand, I'd much rather err on the side of caution and care too much about my craft rather than caring too little. I'm interested to hear my network's thoughts and opinions on the matter.
