# The Moral Obligation of Management

While reading "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi, I was particularly struck by a passage where the Author comes to a realization that in the high-stakes world of neurosurgery, being excellent at your job is a moral responsibility.

> The pain of failure had led me to understand that technical excellence was a moral requirement. Good intentions were not enough, not when so much depended on my skills, when the difference between tragedy and triumph was defined by one or two millimeters.
> 
> \- Paul Kalanithi

I'm not in neurosurgery - the results of my professional work are almost certainly not going to be life and death, however as I have moved through my own career gaining more and more responsibility, the moral obligation I feel to be excellent at my job has increased. To explore this rather personal phenomenon I experienced, I'm going to talk about the Moral Obligation to Be Excellent (MOBE) in the context of having people management responsibilities.

One of the most important things for managers to recognize and respect is that they have a direct and potentially huge impact on their team's wellbeing.

Improving your emotional intelligence can have a huge impact on the people around you.

This is all great for your people - but don't you have a responsibility to your business as well?

Take responsibility for developing your emotional intelligence and managerial skills. Leveraging those learnings to support your people will improve the wellbeing of your team and the results of your business. It's the morally right thing to do.
